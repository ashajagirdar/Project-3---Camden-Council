# Project-3---Camden-Council

**Project Overview**:

This project was done for the data department for the London Borough of Camden Council. 

The council identified some data that they think will support upcoming projects as part of the council’s new data initiative. The data includes a list of trees in the borough. They hope that this data will support the following projects:

- Public Tree Data: 
Provide a list of all trees in the borough, which can be downloaded by the public for free from the Camden Council website. The Borough of Camden is committed to the “opendata” initiative and are interested in opening their data as much as possible to its citizens and to the world.

- Tree Walks Brochures: 
Create a series of “Tree Walks” brochures, each one of which is a guided walk around an individual park showing a map of the location of interesting trees.

- Environment Report: 
Put up a single page on the Camden Council website showing the total carbon and pollution benefit provided by all their trees. This will also show information about trees removed, trees planted and the net carbon and pollution impact of this activity.


**Project Objective**:

- The main objective for this project was to evaluate the data and determine the extent to which this is possible.
- Use **Python** to conduct analysis on the data 

**Attached files**:
- Jupyter Notebook PDF - this was the workbook I used to conduct the analysis in PDF form
- Data source list - I documented the data sources using this list 
- Data requirements list - this helped with understanding what data is used to satisfy what requirements will help identify gaps and provide vital information required to streamline or automate the data acquisition task
